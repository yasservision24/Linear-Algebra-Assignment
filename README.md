# Linear-Algebra-Project
 This is the Assignment for the course Linear Algebra done in the first semester at the IIITD(Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi).


Assignment
Write a program in Python to solve the homogenous system Ax=0 and write the general solution in parametric vector form.

Your program should accept as input the size of the matrix, i.e. the number of rows and the number of columns of A, and also the entries of A.

The input should ideally be read from a text file, but if you haven't learnt how to do this, you may hard-code your input, as long as you are able to explain to your TA how to change the input to your program.

Your code should be based on algorithms learned in the course. No pre-existing routines from Python libraries should be used.
